Overview

The 3D-KInematic Data aNalysis Algorithm for Surveys (3KIDNAS, pronounced the same as echidnas), is a pipeline for kinematically modelling resolved galaxies.  This page contains extensive documentation of how to install and use the code, as well as the underlying structure for those who wish to modify the code.  We also list a few of the known issues and future improvements.
