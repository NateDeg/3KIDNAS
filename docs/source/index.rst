3KIDNAS documentation!
===================================

The 3D-Kinematic Data aNalysis Algorithm for Surveys (3KIDNAS, pronounced the same as echidnas), is a pipeline for kinematically modelling resolved galaxies.  This models are produced via tilted ring modelling.

This page contains extensive documentation of how to install and use the code, as well as a description of tilted ring modelling, the underlying structure or the code for those who wish to modify it.  We also list a few of the known issues and future improvements.
