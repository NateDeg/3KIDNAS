# CosmosCanvas
A library for creating useful colour maps for different astrophysical properties, that relies on Gilles Ferrand's [colourspace](https://github.com/gillesferrand/colourspace).

Tutorials, in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3), highlight different features:
1. **1. Plot Spectral Index.ipynb** shows the Spectral Index colour map tools.
2. **2. Plot Spectral Index Error.ipynb** shows how to make a spectral index error map.
3. **3. Plot Velocity Fields.ipnb** demonstrates how to create velocity field maps.
by Mark Richardson, Jayanne English, Gilles Ferrand and Nathan Deg.

Full descriptions of the perceptual elements are presented in the tutorials along with explicit examples of python code.
